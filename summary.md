## Dataset Description
The dataset used is **"Students Performance in Exams"** from Kaggle. It consists of 1,000 student records with features like gender, ethnicity, parental education, and exam scores.

## Machine Learning Problem Definition
* **Problem Type:** Regression.
* **Target Variable:** `math score`.
* **Model Goal:** The model is expected to predict a student's numerical score in Mathematics by learning patterns from their demographic and educational background.

## Problem Statement
The goal is to analyze how factors such as parental education, lunch types, and test preparation influence academic outcomes. By applying regression, we aim to build a model that estimates a student's performance based on these specific predictors.
